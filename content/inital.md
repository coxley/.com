Initial blog post.

## What's going on

Using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate static files, I've created this
space on the inet. The plan, at least, is to stop having lengthy discussions in
my head during commutes and use this as a home for them instead.

I work professionally somewhere between a network and systems engineer in the
Bay area and am very opinionated. Things to watch this space for in the coming
weeks may include:

* Previous experience automating Cisco devices
* Get the most out of the `Trigger` automation toolkit
* Using NSoT as a single source of truth for both Trigger and Ansible


I've tried this in the past and never kept going, though in that case I never
made an initial post. We'll see...
