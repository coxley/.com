title: About me
---

I'm an ops engineer @ [Yelp](http://yelp.com/engineering), working on systems
and networking.

Am a big proponent of End-to-End engineering, network automation, a programmer
by trade and strict follower of UNIX philosophies.

Want to learn more? Feel free to check out my
[resume](http://resume.coxley.com) or reach out to `codey` on Freenode where I
call `#packetpushers` home.
